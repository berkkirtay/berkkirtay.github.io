This is the most significant concept about evolution and nature. In software we change the term adaptability with optimality. There is never a perfect solution. It is pretty much like nature; there is no perfect DNA sequence, but there will always be one which is the most adaptable.

But those algorithms do not work in polynomial time complexity. They can have exponential time complexities and therefore consume too much computational power and until we found an optimal solution with them.
